    Abstract base class for MuJoCo robot simulations.

    This class serves as the foundational framework for simulating robots in MuJoCo. It defines
    key properties and methods that must be implemented in subclasses, including access to
    the simulation's dynamic data (`MjData`), the static model (`MjModel`), and control mechanisms.

    Child classes are responsible for implementing the control logic (`control_loop`) and handling
    user inputs via the keyboard (`keyboard_callback`). The `run` method provides a basic structure
    for running the main simulation loop, handling viewer synchronization, and processing user inputs
    in real-time.

    This base class includes functionality to issue warnings if important methods, such as the control
    loop or keyboard callback, are not implemented in a subclass.
